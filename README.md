Risk Management Problem Set 3

Choosing a VaR technique

Download the excel file which contains the time series of gains for a strategy from 8/8/2006 to 9/25/2008.

1. For each day in 2007-2008, compute historical VaR and exponential weighted 1-day 99%-VaR. Comment on the exceptions that happen with these two
measures.

2. For each day in the sample, compute the 95% confidence intervals of the historical VaR and the exponential weighted VaR you obtained in Question
1, using both parametric (for the historical VaR) and bootstrap methods (for the two measures). For the parametric method, assume the gains are
normally distributed.

3. Assess the normality of the gain distribution.

4. For each day in the sample, compute the volatility of the portfolio in the past month. Normalize gains with estimated volatility. Compare the
distribution of the normalized gain with the original one and discuss which is closer to normal distribution.

5. Repeat Question 4 but assuming that somebody tells you in advance what the volatility will be in the next month.

6. Write a proposal to the head of trading for measuring the risk of this trade in real time, justifying your choices.
